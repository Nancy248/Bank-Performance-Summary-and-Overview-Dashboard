# Bank-Performance-Summary-and-Overview-Dashboard
Developed a comprehensive two-page Excel dashboard summarizing and visualizing bank loan data for performance analysis.

Page 1 (Summary): Provided key metrics such as total loan applications (38.6K), funded amount ($435.8M), received amount ($473.1M), interest rates, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), along with a comparison of good vs. bad loan performance.

Page 2 (Overview): Showcased detailed insights including loan applications by month, term, employee length, home ownership, and purpose using interactive visualizations such as bar charts, donut charts, and maps.

Enabled easy filtering and exploration of data by loan grade and purpose using slicers
